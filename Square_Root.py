# Python Program to find the Square Root.
# 1st Method (Using Exponentiation)
# num = 64
# sr = num**(1/2)
# print("The Square Root of the Given Number is: ", sr)

# 2nd Method (With User Inputs)
# num = int(input("Enter a Number Here: "))
# sr = num**(0.5)
# print("The Square Root of the Given Number is: ", sr)

# 3rd Method (Using Math Module)
import math
num = int(input("Enter a Number Here: "))
sr = math.sqrt(num)
print("The Square Root of the Given Number is", sr)
